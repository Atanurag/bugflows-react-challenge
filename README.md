# React.js Coding Challenge – Bugflows

## 🧪 Objective:
Convert the given static login page (HTML/CSS/JS) into a clean, modular React.js application.

---

## ✅ Requirements:
- Use **React Functional Components** (no class components).
- Convert HTML to valid JSX.
- Move styles into either CSS modules or keep them in a single global file.
- Add a `LoginForm` component that handles the form submission using `useState` and `onSubmit`.

---

## 🗂 Suggested Folder Structure:

```
/src
 ┣ /components
 ┃ ┗ LoginForm.jsx
 ┣ App.jsx
 ┗ index.js
```

---

## ⚙️ Notes:
- You may use Create React App or Vite.
- Do **not** use UI libraries like Bootstrap or MUI.
- The form doesn't need real login logic — just a `console.log` or `alert` on submit is fine.
